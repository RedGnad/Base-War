/**
 * Getting around, as a panel rather than a row of buttons under the thumb.
 *
 * These four controls used to live in a strip across the bottom of the screen, expanding
 * as they were needed: TRAVEL, then GO HOME, TO BELT and MOVE beside it. Laid end to end
 * they came to roughly eight hundred and sixty pixels inside a container of seven hundred
 * and sixty, so the last of them hung off its own frame. The deeper problem is that they
 * were on screen during play at all: a player travels a handful of times in a session and
 * shoots continuously, and the two were competing for the same corner.
 *
 * So travel moved behind the menu, where a rare action belongs, and the room it freed at
 * the bottom went back to the game. Each entry is a full-width row with its own line of
 * explanation, which is what the space allows once four controls stop fighting for it.
